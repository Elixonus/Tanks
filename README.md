# TankGame
TankGame is amazing and wondrous and beautiful and was created by Matei Budiu, Karan Gurazada, and Hallowizer.
It is, as one suspects, a game involving all sorts of tanks (12?) and really a natural extension of the Wii Play tanks game.
It is still very much in development and is also extremely difficult (as in unplayable).
