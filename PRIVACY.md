# Privacy Policy

## Data we collect
Tanks will not collect any data from its users, with a single exception: the official Tanks Online service.
When a user connects to Tanks Online, the server will collect data in order to store the content that the user
has uploaded, and any other similar data needed to keep track of a player's profile on the online service.
If you have used Tanks Online and wish to delete all data the service stores about you, please contact us.

## Personally-identifiable data
Tanks does not collect any information that can be used to personally identify users.

## Data we share
Tanks will not share any data it has collected to any other companies for any purpose other than to keep the service running.
Data collected will not be sold for money to any company or individual.

## Online safety
As with many other online services, Tanks Online contains user-generated content (in the form of things like levels).
Although we do not permit inappropriate or offensive content to be posted on the service, we may not be able to catch everything. 
Thus, this service may not be suitable for young children. Users under the age which their law requires (often 13) should
obtain permission from their parents before using Tanks Online.
If you see any inappropriate content, please help us by contacting us to report the content.
