This package is for old classes which have been removed in favor of newer classes:
Specifically, this is the graveyard of all those classes for enemy tanks which did not use EnemyTankDynamic.

Do not use these class files for anything!!!
The only purpose of keeping these files is to make sure that they are ported correctly.
After we are done using them, they may be removed with no further notice.

May the deceased class files rest in peace here...
